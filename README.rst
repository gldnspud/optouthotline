Opt Out Hotline
===============

This is the code behind http://optouthotline.com/, a website intended
to provide a public hotline and dispatching service to those who opt
out of full-body scanning and other intrusive violations of privacy:

1. Opt-outer prints PDF to take with them, with travel tips, phrases
   to use in airport security scenarios, and notes area.

2. Opt-outer travels and declines full body scan, receives
   "alternative" full body pat-down.

3. Opt-outer records information about the incident, including
   airport, badge numbers, any information about property and bodily
   area searches.

4. Opt-outer posts anonymous notes about the incident to
   optouthotline.com, or contacts a phone hotline, leaving a voice
   mail with incident details and commentary and permission to post
   the voice mail.

5. Optouthotline.com displays anonymous reports and publishes them
   to twitter and RSS.

Please follow and fork this repository if you'd like to help build the
project.
