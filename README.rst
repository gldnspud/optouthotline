Opt Out Hotline
===============

This is the code behind http://optouthotline.com/, a website intended
to provide a public hotline and dispatching service to those who opt
out of full-body scanning and other intrusive violations of privacy.

Please follow and fork this repository if you'd like to help build the
project.

The idea is to use http://tropo.com/ to provide a programmable hotline
service, and pair that with a website that has a printable PDF of
travel tips for opt-outers, complete with a "notes" area for writing
names, dates and times, and badge numbers.
